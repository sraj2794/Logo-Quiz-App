Logo Quiz

We would want you to build a simple Android/iOS game that shows logos and captures the response from the player. The aim of the game is to match the player's input with the name of the logo in the least time.



Rules:
We have provided a json file (logo.txt) which contains a list of logos. Each entry consists of the logo image URL and the correct name of the logo. You need to display the logos one by one and collect the answer from the player. Make sure that the pool of letters that you present to the player contains the correct letters. When the player enters the correct name, he would earn points.

Evaluation:

Code style & modularity - 60 points
 We would like your code to be as close to production quality as possible. It's OK if the game isn't fully functional - as a matter of fact, we wouldnâ€™t run the app and check the UI. We want you to write high-quality code. Imagine that this game will be played by Millions of players and you are part of the team which builds it.

Extendability and Abstraction - 20 points
If a new requirement comes up, how easy is it to modify the code? How many places would you have to touch in order to achieve the results? Fancy UI or animation is not expected. The image shown is only for reference; not a design specification.
